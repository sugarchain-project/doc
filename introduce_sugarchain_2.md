## Long version

Sugarchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network supported by an open-source blockchain protocol, launched by Zenny Kim and Volodymyr Biloshytskyi in August 2019. Through Sugarchain, users can make payments to anyone in the world at the highest speeds ***in 5 seconds***, and the lowest costs compared to other digital assets. For example, the transaction speed of Sugarchain is 120 times faster than Bitcoin, 30 times faster than Litecoin and 12 times faster than Dogecoin.

The Sugarchain Project emerged as an alternative solution to Bitcoin in light of early concerns over Bitcoinâ€™s wait times in confirming block transactions and rounding errors in block reward halving. By introducing minor technical modifications to the original Bitcoin source code, Sugarchain allowed for much faster transaction speeds, even lower processing fees and has ***the most accurate block reward halving and total supply*** than any other digital asset, including Bitcoin. Sugarchain also launched following the ***one-CPU-one-vote*** idea proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto himself, thus making YespowerSugar GPU and ASIC resistant. It has also launched as being the first blockchain to have ***Native SegWit (Bech32)*** enabled by default.

As one of successful derivatives of Bitcoin, Sugarchain is establishing its position as ***the world's fastest PoW blockchain***, complementing and reinforcing Bitcoin in purpose, function, and utility, and challenging our traditional notions of money. The Sugarchain Project has ***never been funded through an ICO or premine***, making it a fair launch. Sugarchain is an entirely community and voluntarily driven project, with no external company or funding supporting it apart from community funding.
