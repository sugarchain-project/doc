## Long version

Sugarchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network supported by an open-source blockchain protocol. Through Sugarchain, users can make payments to anyone in the world at the highest speeds ***in 5 seconds*** and the lowest costs compared to other digital assets. For example the transaction speed of Sugarchain is 120 times faster than Bitcoin, 30 times faster than Litecoin and 12 times faster than Dogecoin. It was launched in August 2019 by Zenny Kim and Volodymyr Biloshytskyi.

The Sugarchain Project emerged as an alternative solution to Bitcoin in light of early concerns over Bitcoinâ€™s wait times in confirming block transactions and rounding error in halving block reward. By introducing minor technical modifications to the original Bitcoin source code, Sugarchain allowed for much faster transaction speeds and even lower processing fees, and has ***the most accurate block reward halving and total supply*** than other digital assets include Bitcoin. Besides Sugarchain is following Satoshi Nakamoto's ***one-CPU-one-vote*** model therefore GPU and ASIC mining is not possible, and ***the first Native SegWit (Bech32) by default*** since its launching.

As one of successful derivatives of Bitcoin, Sugarchain is establishing its position as ***the world's fastest PoW blockchain***, complementing and reinforcing Bitcoin in purpose, function, and utility, and challenging our traditional notions of money. Also the Sugarchain Project has ***never been funded through an ICO or premine***. There is no CEO or a company controlling the Sugarchain blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.
